# Personal Workspace Design Plan

## Current Phase: Design Document Creation

Before proceeding with implementation, we are focusing on outlining the design and requirements for the personal workspace application.

## Initial Thoughts for Design Document Sections:

1.  **Main Features:**
    *   To-do list
    *   Note taking
    *   Reminder

2.  **Page Structure:**
    *   Overall layout
    *   Navigation

3.  **UI/UX Design:**
    *   Color themes
    *   Component appearance

4.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   Frontend: React (proposed)
    *   Styling: Tailwind CSS (existing)
    *   Build Tool: Vite (proposed)

Further details and discussion will be added here.
