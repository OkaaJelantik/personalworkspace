# Personal Workspace Design Plan

## Current Phase: Design Document Creation

Before proceeding with implementation, we are focusing on outlining the design and requirements for the personal workspace application.

## Initial Thoughts for Design Document Sections:

1.  **Main Features:**
    *   Integrated to-do list and note-taking functionality.

2.  **Page Structure:**
    *   Overall layout
    *   Navigation

3.  **UI/UX Design:**
    *   Color themes
    *   Component appearance

4.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   Frontend: React (proposed)
    *   Styling: Tailwind CSS (existing)
    *   Build Tool: Vite (proposed)

5.  **Feature Details:**
    *   **To-do list:**
        *   The to-do list will be presented in a table format.
        *   Each row in the table will represent a to-do item.
        *   Each to-do item will have a checkbox to mark it as complete.
        *   Each to-do item will be a note-taking area, allowing users to add detailed notes within the to-do list.
        *   Each to-do item will have a deadline for its completion, including time. The deadline text will turn red if it has passed.
        *   Each to-do item will have a priority level (Low, Medium, High).
    *   **Real-time Clock:** A real-time clock will be displayed on the page, showing the date, hour, and minute in 24-hour format.

Further details and discussion will be added here.
